# Spy-Communication-Tool
Hello everyone, this is my solution to the Elementary Problem State of the Cyber Cypher Event.  

This tool that allows the spies to communicate in a secure way by encrypting the messages such that only those with the key can decrypt their messages.
Currently it works on a single machine but in the future it can be implemented on multiple machines by using Socket Programming.
